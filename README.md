# GPU Mode

GPU Mode is a thriving community of GPU enthusiasts, developers, and researchers dedicated to advancing the field of GPU programming and parallel computing.

## What is GPU Programming?

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) programming harnesses the massive parallel processing power of graphics cards for general-purpose computing tasks. Unlike CPUs which are optimized for sequential processing, GPUs excel at performing the same operation across large datasets simultaneously.

### Key Concepts:

- **Parallel Processing**: Execute thousands of threads concurrently
- **SIMD Architecture**: Single Instruction, Multiple Data execution model
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Efficient data management across different memory types
- **Kernel Programming**: Writing specialized functions for GPU execution

## Popular GPU Programming Frameworks

- CUDA (NVIDIA)
- ROCm (AMD)
- Metal (Apple)
- WebGPU (Web browsers)
